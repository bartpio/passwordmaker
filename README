passwordmaker.html is a modified version of the downloadable javascript version
of PasswordMaker from http://passwordmaker.org/Javascript .  It gets loaded
into a popup window when a user needs to type in his master password.

passwordmaker-custom.js contains all the custom modifications that were needed
to make passwordmaker.html work as a Chrome extension.

icon*.png are derived from the favicon from the PasswordMaker site.

The rest are standard extension bits.
